# fluxth's personal configuration

This repository contains my development environment configuration.

An install script `dotfiles.sh` is included to manage linking/unlinking of configuration and also to get a fresh install of Linux/macOS up and running with full-fledged packages and configuration in one command!

`main` branch is always tracked to my current setup, so it might break sometimes. Use with caution, but feel free to hack around! ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

```

To install baseline packages, GUI packages and link dotfiles, run:
```bash
./dotfiles.sh full-install
```
